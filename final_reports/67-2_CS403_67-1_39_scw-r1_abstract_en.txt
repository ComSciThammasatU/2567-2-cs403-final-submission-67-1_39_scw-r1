AI-BASED MOTORCYCLE PARTS RECOGNITION SYSTEM
This project aims to develop a motorcycle spare parts recognition system using uploaded or captured images to analyze and identify spare part information. The process includes collecting spare part data, annotating the data to specify key features for training an AI model, and developing an application that can process images and display results in an easily understandable format. The system emphasizes the application of Image Processing and Machine Learning technologies to enhance the accuracy of image analysis and spare part identification. The results of this project will help reduce the time and errors involved in searching for spare parts while improving data management efficiency for shops or mechanics. Furthermore, it serves as a prototype for developing applications in other spare part industries, such as the automotive industry.
